      "I beg your pardon I never promised you a rose garden Along with the sunshine There's gotta be a little rain some time When you take you gotta give so live and let live Or let go oh-whoa-whoa-whoa I beg your pardon I never promised you a rose garden I could promise you things like big diamond rings But you don't find roses growin' on stalks of clover So you better think it over Well if sweet-talkin' you could make it come true I would give you the world right now on a silver platter But what would it matter So smile for a while and let's be jolly Love shouldn't be so melancholy Come along and share the good times while we can I beg your pardon I never promised you a rose garden Along with the sunshine There's gotta be a little rain some time I beg your pardon I never promised you a rose garden I could sing you a tune and promise you the moon But if that's what it takes to hold you I'd just as soon let you go But there's one thing I want you to know You better look before you leap, still waters run deep And there won't always be someone there to pull you out And you know what I'm talkin' about So smile for a while and let's be jolly Love shouldn't be so melancholy Come along and share the good times while we can I beg your pardon I never promised you a rose garden Along with the sunshine There's gotta be a little rain some time I've been walkin' these streets so long Singin' the same old song I know every crack in these dirty sidewalks of Broadway Where hustle's the name of the game And nice guys get washed away like the snow and the rain There's been a load of compromisin' On the road to my horizon But I'm gonna be where the lights are shinin' on me Like a rhinestone cowboy Riding out on a horse in a star-spangled rodeo Like a rhinestone cowboy Getting cards and letters from people I don't even know And offers comin' over the phone Well, I really don't mind the rain And a smile can hide all the pain But you're down when you're ridin' the train that's takin' the long way And I dream of the things I'll do With a subway token and a dollar tucked inside my shoe There'll be a load of compromisin' On the road to my horizon But I'm gonna be where the lights are shinin' on me Like a rhinestone cowboy Riding out on a horse in a star-spangled rodeo Rhinestone cowboy Gettin' cards and letters from people I don't even know And offers comin' over the phone Like a rhinestone cowboy Riding out on a horse in a star-spangled rodeo Like a rhinestone cowboy Gettin' card and letters from people I don't even know Like a rhinestone cowboy Riding out on a horse in a star-spangled rodeo When ever I chance to meet, some old friends on the street They wonder how does a man get to be this way I've always got a smiling face, anytime & any place And every time they ask me why I just smile & say You've got to kiss an angel good morning And let her know you think about her when you're gone Kiss an angel good morning And love her like the devil when you get back home Well people may try to guess, the secret of my happiness But some of them never learn it's a simple thing The secret I'm speaking of, is a woman & a man in love And the answer is in this song that I always sing You've got to kiss an angel good morning And let her know you think about her when you're gone Kiss an angel good morning And love her like the devil when you get back home Kiss an angel good morning And let her know you think about her when you're gone Kiss an angel good morning And love her like the devil when you get back home I hear people talkin' bad, About the way they have to live here in this country Harpin' on the wars we fight And gripin' 'bout the way things oughta be And I don't mind 'em switchin' sides And standin' up for things they believe in But when they're runnin' down our country, man They're walkin' on the fightin' side of me They're walkin' on the fightin' side of me Runnin' down a way of life Our fightin' men have fought and died to keep If you don't love it, leave it Let this song that I'm singin' be a warnin' When you're runnin' down our country, hoss You're walkin' on the fightin' side of me I read about some squirrelly guy Who claims that he just don't believe in fightin' And I wonder just how long The rest of us can count on bein' free They love our milk and honey But they preach about some other way of livin' But when they're runnin' down our country, man They're walkin' on the fightin' side of me They're walkin' on the fightin' side of me Runnin' down the way of life Our fightin' men have fought and died to keep If you don't love it, leave it Let this song that I'm singin' be a warnin' When you're runnin' down our country, man You're walkin' on the fightin' side of me You're walkin' on the fightin' side of me Runnin' down the way of life Our fightin' men have fought and died to keep If you don't love it, leave it Let this song that I'm singin' be a warnin' When you're runnin' down our country, hoss You're walkin' on the fightin' side of me Don't know when I've been so blue Don't know what's come over you You've found someone new and Don't it make my brown eyes blue I'll be fine when you're gone I'll just cry all night long Say it isn't true and Don't it make my brown eyes blue Tell me no secrets, tell me some lies Give me no reasons, give me alibies Tell me you love me and don't let me cry Say anything but don't say goodbye I didn't mean to treat you bad Didn't know just what I had But honey now I do And don't it make my brown eyes Don't it make my brown eyes Don't it make my brown eyes blue Well I woke up Sunday morning With no way to hold my head That didn't hurt And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't Bad so I had one more for dessert Then I fumbled through my closet For my clothes And found my cleanest dirty shirt And I shaved my face And combed my hair And stumbled down the stairs To meet the day I'd smoked my brain the night before With cigarettes and songs That I've been pickin' But I lit my first and watched a small kid Cussin' at a can that he was kickin Then I crossed the empty street and Caught the sunday smell Of someone fryin chicken And it took me back to something That I'd lost somehow Somewhere along the way On the sunday morning sidewalk Wishing lord that I was stoned Cause there's something in a sunday That makes a body feel alone And there's nothing short of dying Half as lonesome as the sound On the sleeping city sidewalk Sunday morning coming down In the park I saw a daddy With a laughing little girl He was swingin And I stopped beside the Sunday school And listened to the song That they were singing Then I headed back for home And somewhere far away A lonely bell was ringing And it echoed thru the canyon like The disappearing dreams of yesterday On the sunday morning sidewalk Wishing lord that I was stoned Cause therels something in a sunday That makes a body feel alone And there's nothing short of dying Half as lonesome as the sound On the sleeping city sidewalk Sunday morning coming down Almost heaven, West Virginia Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River Life is old there, older than the trees Younger than the mountains, blowing like a breeze Country roads, take me home To the place I belong West Virginia, mountain mama Take me home, country roads All my memories gather round her Miner's lady, stranger to blue water Dark and dusty, painted on the sky Misty taste of moonshine, teardrop in my eye Country roads, take me home To the place I belong West Virginia, mountain mama Take me home, country roads I hear her voice, in the morning hour she calls me The radio reminds me of my home far away And driving down the road I get a feeling That I should have been home yesterday, yesterday Country roads, take me home To the place I belong West Virginia, mountain mama Take me home, country roads Country roads, take me home To the place I belong West Virginia, mountain mama Take me home, country roads Take me home, down country roads Take me home, down country roads Well life on the farm is kinda laid back Ain't much an old country boy like me can't hack It's early to rise,

I mean Thank God I'm a country boy Well I got me a fine wife I got me an ole fiddle When the sun's comin' up I got cakes on the griddle Life ain't nothin' but a funny funny riddle Thank God I'm a

of I wish you joy And I wish you happiness But above all this I wish you love And I love you will always love you I, I will always, always love you I will always love you I will always love you I will always love you Rain dripping off the brim of my hat It sure is cold today And here I am'a walking down sixty-six Wish she hadn't done me that way Sleeping under a table at a road side park A man could wake up dead But it sure seems warmer than it did Sleepin' in our king size bed Is anybody goin' to San Antone Or Phoenix Arizona Anyplace is alright as long as I Can forget I've ever known her Wind whipping down the neck of my shirt Like I aint got nothing on But I'd rather fight the wind and rain Than what I've been fighting at home Yonder comes a truck with the US mail People writing letters back home Tomorrow she'll probably want me back But I'll still be just as gone Is anybody goin' to San Antone Or Phoenix Arizona Anyplace is alright as long as I Can forget I've ever known her Anyplace is alright as long as I Forget I've ever known her Cowboys ain't easy to love and they're harder to hold They'd rather give you a song then diamonds or gold Lonestar belt buckles and old faded Levi's and each night begins a new day If you don't understand him and he don't die young He'll probably just ride away Mamas' don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys Don't let 'em pick guitars or drive them old trucks Let 'em be doctors and lawyers and such Mamas' don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys Cause they'll never stay home and they're always alone Even with someone they love Cowboys like smokey old pool rooms and clear mountain mornin's Little warm puppies and children and girls of the night Them that don't know him won't like him And them that do sometimes won't know how to take him He ain't wrong he's just different But his pride won't let him do things to make you think he's right Mama don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys Don't let 'em pick guitars and drive them old trucks Let 'em be doctors and lawyers and such Mama don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys Cause they'll never stay home and they're always alone Even with someone they

But I just can't let you go without telling you just how much I love you. So that is why I'm gonna say it one more time Honey, come back I just can't stand Each lonely day's a little bit longer Than the last time I held you Seems like a hundred years ago Back to his arms and never know The joy of love that used to taste like Honey, come back where you belong to only me.

Everyone considered him the coward of the county He'd never stood one single time to prove the county wrong His mama named him Tommy, but folks just called him yellow Something always told me they were reading Tommy wrong He was only ten years old when his daddy died in prison I looked after Tommy, 'cause he was my brother's son I still recall the final words my brother said to Tommy \"\"\"Son, my life is over, but yours has just begun\"\"\" \"\"\"Promise me, son, not to do the things I've done\" Walk away from trouble if you can It won't mean you're weak if you turn the other cheek I hope you're old enough to understand \"Son, you don't have to fight to be a man\"\"\" There's someone for everyone, and Tommy's love was Becky In her arms, he didn't have to prove he was a man One day while he was working, the Gatlin boys came calling They took turns at Becky, n'there was three of them Tommy opened up the door, and saw his Becky crying The torn dress, the shattered look was more than he could stand He reached above the fireplace, and took down his daddy's picture As the tears fell on his daddy's face, he heard these words again \"\"\"Promise me, son, not to do the things I've done\" Walk away from trouble if you can Now, it won't mean you're weak if you turn the other cheek I hope you're old enough to understand \"Son, you don't have to fight to be a man\"\"\" The Gatlin boys just laughed at him when he walked into the barroom One of them got up and met him halfway 'cross the floor \"When Tommy turned around they said, \"\"hey look, old yeller's leaving\"\"\" But you could've heard a pin drop when Tommy stopped and locked the door Twenty years of crawling was bottled up inside him He wasn't holding nothin' back, he let 'em have it all When Tommy left the barroom, not a Gatlin boy was standing \"He said, \"\"this one's for Becky, as he watched the last one fall\" \"\"\"I promised you, Dad, not to do the things you've done\" I walk away from trouble when I can Now please don't think I'm weak, I didn't turn the other cheek And papa, I sure hope you understand \"Sometimes you gotta fight when you're a man\"\"\" There goes my only possession There goes my everything I hear footsteps slowly walking As they gently walk across the lonely floor And a voice is softly saying Darling this will be goodbye for evermore There goes my reason for living There goes the one of my dreams There goes my only possession Oh there goes my everything As my memory turns back the pages I can see the happy years we've had before Now the love that kept this old heart beating Has been shattered by the closing of the door There goes my reason for living There goes the one of my dreams Well there goes my only possession Oh there goes my everything There goes my only possession Oh there goes my everything A long time forgotten are dreams that just fell by the way The good life he promised ain't what she's living today But she never complains of the bad times or bad things he's done, Lord She just talks about the good times they've had and all the good times to come She's a good-hearted woman in love with a good-timin' man She loves him in spite of his ways that she don't understand Through teardrops and laughter, they'll pass through this world hand-in-hand, A good-hearted woman loving her good timing man He like the night life, the bright lights and good-timin' friends When the party's all over she'll welcome him back home again Lord knows she don't understand him, but she does the best that she can Cause she's a good-hearted woman;

If you were a carpenter And I were a lady I'd marry you anyway I'd have your baby If a tinker was my trade Would I still find you I'd be carrying the pots you made Following behind you Save your love through loneliness Save your love through sorrow I gave you my onlyness Give me your tomorrow If I were a miller And a mill wheel grinding Would you miss your colored blouse And your soft shoes shining? If you were a miller And a mill wheel grinding I'd not miss my colored blouse And my soft shoes shining Save your love through loneliness Save your love through sorrow I gave you my onlyness Give me your tomorrow If I worked my hands on wood Would you still love me? I'd answer you yes I would And would you not be above me? If I were a carpenter And you were a lady I'd marry you anyway I'd have your baby Save your love through loneliness Save your love through sorrow I gave you my onlyness Give me your tomorrow\n"
