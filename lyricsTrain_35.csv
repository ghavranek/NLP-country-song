lyrics
I beg your pardon
I never promised you a rose garden
Along with the sunshine
There's gotta be a little rain some time
When you take you gotta give so live and let live
Or let go oh-whoa-whoa-whoa
I beg your pardon
I never promised you a rose garden
I could promise you things like big diamond rings
But you don't find roses growin' on stalks of clover
So you better think it over
Well if sweet-talkin' you could make it come true
I would give you the world right now on a silver platter
But what would it matter
So smile for a while and let's be jolly
Love shouldn't be so melancholy
Come along and share the good times while we can
I beg your pardon
I never promised you a rose garden
Along with the sunshine
There's gotta be a little rain some time
I beg your pardon
I never promised you a rose garden
I could sing you a tune and promise you the moon
But if that's what it takes to hold you
I'd just as soon let you go
But there's one thing I want you to know
"You better look before you leap, still waters run deep"
And there won't always be someone there to pull you out
And you know what I'm talkin' about
So smile for a while and let's be jolly
Love shouldn't be so melancholy
Come along and share the good times while we can
I beg your pardon
I never promised you a rose garden
Along with the sunshine
There's gotta be a little rain some time
I've been walkin' these streets so long
Singin' the same old song
I know every crack in these dirty sidewalks of Broadway
Where hustle's the name of the game
And nice guys get washed away like the snow and the rain
There's been a load of compromisin'
On the road to my horizon
But I'm gonna be where the lights are shinin' on me
Like a rhinestone cowboy
Riding out on a horse in a star-spangled rodeo
Like a rhinestone cowboy
Getting cards and letters from people I don't even know
And offers comin' over the phone
"Well, I really don't mind the rain"
And a smile can hide all the pain
But you're down when you're ridin' the train that's takin' the long way
And I dream of the things I'll do
With a subway token and a dollar tucked inside my shoe
There'll be a load of compromisin'
On the road to my horizon
But I'm gonna be where the lights are shinin' on me
Like a rhinestone cowboy
Riding out on a horse in a star-spangled rodeo
Rhinestone cowboy
Gettin' cards and letters from people I don't even know
And offers comin' over the phone
Like a rhinestone cowboy
Riding out on a horse in a star-spangled rodeo
Like a rhinestone cowboy
Gettin' card and letters from people I don't even know
Like a rhinestone cowboy
Riding out on a horse in a star-spangled rodeo
"When ever I chance to meet, some old friends on the street"
They wonder how does a man get to be this way
"I've always got a smiling face, anytime & any place"
And every time they ask me why I just smile & say
You've got to kiss an angel good morning
And let her know you think about her when you're gone
Kiss an angel good morning
And love her like the devil when you get back home
"Well people may try to guess, the secret of my happiness"
But some of them never learn it's a simple thing
"The secret I'm speaking of, is a woman & a man in love"
And the answer is in this song that I always sing
You've got to kiss an angel good morning
And let her know you think about her when you're gone
Kiss an angel good morning
And love her like the devil when you get back home
Kiss an angel good morning
And let her know you think about her when you're gone
Kiss an angel good morning
And love her like the devil when you get back home
"I hear people talkin' bad,"
About the way they have to live here in this country
Harpin' on the wars we fight
And gripin' 'bout the way things oughta be
And I don't mind 'em switchin' sides
And standin' up for things they believe in
"But when they're runnin' down our country, man"
They're walkin' on the fightin' side of me
They're walkin' on the fightin' side of me
Runnin' down a way of life
Our fightin' men have fought and died to keep
"If you don't love it, leave it"
Let this song that I'm singin' be a warnin'
"When you're runnin' down our country, hoss"
You're walkin' on the fightin' side of me
I read about some squirrelly guy
Who claims that he just don't believe in fightin'
And I wonder just how long
The rest of us can count on bein' free
They love our milk and honey
But they preach about some other way of livin'
"But when they're runnin' down our country, man"
They're walkin' on the fightin' side of me
They're walkin' on the fightin' side of me
Runnin' down the way of life
Our fightin' men have fought and died to keep
"If you don't love it, leave it"
Let this song that I'm singin' be a warnin'
"When you're runnin' down our country, man"
You're walkin' on the fightin' side of me
You're walkin' on the fightin' side of me
Runnin' down the way of life
Our fightin' men have fought and died to keep
"If you don't love it, leave it"
Let this song that I'm singin' be a warnin'
"When you're runnin' down our country, hoss"
You're walkin' on the fightin' side of me
Don't know when I've been so blue
Don't know what's come over you
You've found someone new and
Don't it make my brown eyes blue
I'll be fine when you're gone
I'll just cry all night long
Say it isn't true and
Don't it make my brown eyes blue
"Tell me no secrets, tell me some lies"
"Give me no reasons, give me alibies"
Tell me you love me and don't let me cry
Say anything but don't say goodbye
I didn't mean to treat you bad
Didn't know just what I had
But honey now I do
And don't it make my brown eyes
Don't it make my brown eyes
Don't it make my brown eyes blue
Well I woke up Sunday morning
With no way to hold my head
That didn't hurt
And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't
Bad so I had one more for dessert
Then I fumbled through my closet
For my clothes
And found my cleanest dirty shirt
And I shaved my face
And combed my hair
And stumbled down the stairs
To meet the day
I'd smoked my brain the night before
With cigarettes and songs
That I've been pickin'
But I lit my first and watched a small kid
Cussin' at a can that he was kickin
Then I crossed the empty street and
Caught the sunday smell
Of someone fryin chicken
And it took me back to something
That I'd lost somehow
Somewhere along the way
On the sunday morning sidewalk
Wishing lord that I was stoned
Cause there's something in a sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing short of dying
Half as lonesome as the sound
On the sleeping city sidewalk
Sunday morning coming down
In the park I saw a daddy
With a laughing little girl
He was swingin
And I stopped beside the Sunday school
And listened to the song
That they were singing
Then I headed back for home
And somewhere far away
A lonely bell was ringing
And it echoed thru the canyon like
The disappearing dreams of yesterday
On the sunday morning sidewalk
Wishing lord that I was stoned
Cause therels something in a sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing short of dying
Half as lonesome as the sound
On the sleeping city sidewalk
Sunday morning coming down
"Almost heaven, West Virginia"
"Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River"
"Life is old there, older than the trees"
"Younger than the mountains, blowing like a breeze"
"Country roads, take me home"
To the place I belong
"West Virginia, mountain mama"
"Take me home, country roads"
All my memories gather round her
"Miner's lady, stranger to blue water"
"Dark and dusty, painted on the sky"
"Misty taste of moonshine, teardrop in my eye"
"Country roads, take me home"
To the place I belong
"West Virginia, mountain mama"
"Take me home, country roads"
"I hear her voice, in the morning hour she calls me"
The radio reminds me of my home far away
And driving down the road I get a feeling
"That I should have been home yesterday, yesterday"
"Country roads, take me home"
To the place I belong
"West Virginia, mountain mama"
"Take me home, country roads"
"Country roads, take me home"
To the place I belong
"West Virginia, mountain mama"
"Take me home, country roads"
"Take me home, down country roads"
"Take me home, down country roads"
Well life on the farm is kinda laid back
Ain't much an old country boy like me can't hack
"It's early to rise, early in the sack"
Thank God I'm a country boy
Well a simple kinda life never did me no harm
A raisin' me a family and workin' on a farm
My days are all filled with an easy country charm
Thank God I'm a country boy
Well I got me a fine wife I got me an ole fiddle
When the sun's comin' up I got cakes on the griddle
Life ain't nothin' but a funny funny riddle
Thank God I'm a country boy
When the work's all done and the sun's settlin' low
I pull out my fiddle and I rosin up the bow
The kids are asleep so I keep it kinda low
Thank God I'm a country boy
I'd play Sally Goodin all day if I could
But the Lord and my wife wouldn't take it very good
"So I fiddle when I can, work when I should"
Thank God I'm a country boy
Well I got me a fine wife I got me an ole fiddle
When the sun's comin' up I got cakes on the griddle
Life ain't nothin' but a funny funny riddle
Thank God I'm a country boy
Well I wouldn't trade my life for diamonds and jewels
I never was one of them money hungry fools
I'd rather have my fiddle and my farmin' tools
Thank God I'm a country boy
"Yeah, city folk drivin' in a black limousine"
A lotta sad people thinkin' that's mighty keen
"Son, let me tell ya now exactly what I mean"
Thank God I'm a country boy
Well I got me a fine wife I got me an ole fiddle
When the sun's comin' up I got cakes on the griddle
Life ain't nothin' but a funny funny riddle
Thank God I'm a country boy
"Well, my fiddle was my daddy's till the day he died"
And he took me by the hand and held me close to his side
"Said, ""Live a good life and play the fiddle with pride"
And thank God you're a country boy
My daddy taught me young how to hunt and how to whittle
Taught me how to work and play a tune on the fiddle
Taught me how to love and how to give just a little
Thank God I'm a country boy
Well I got me a fine wife I got me an ole fiddle
When the sun's comin' up I got cakes on the griddle
Life ain't nothin' but a funny funny riddle
Thank God I'm a country boy
If I should stay
I would only be in your way
"And so I'll go, but I know"
I'll think of you each step of the way
And I will always love you
I will always love you
Bitter-sweet memories
That's all I'm taking with me
"Good-bye, please don't cry"
Cause we both know that I'm not
What you need
I will always love you
I will always love you
"I hope life, treats you kind"
And I hope that you have all
That you ever dreamed of
I wish you joy
And I wish you happiness
But above all this
I wish you love
And I love you will always love you
"I, I will always, always love you"
I will always love you
I will always love you
I will always love you
Rain dripping off the brim of my hat
It sure is cold today
And here I am'a walking down sixty-six
Wish she hadn't done me that way
Sleeping under a table at a road side park
A man could wake up dead
But it sure seems warmer than it did
Sleepin' in our king size bed
Is anybody goin' to San Antone
Or Phoenix Arizona
Anyplace is alright as long as I
Can forget I've ever known her
Wind whipping down the neck of my shirt
Like I aint got nothing on
But I'd rather fight the wind and rain
Than what I've been fighting at home
Yonder comes a truck with the US mail
People writing letters back home
Tomorrow she'll probably want me back
But I'll still be just as gone
Is anybody goin' to San Antone
Or Phoenix Arizona
Anyplace is alright as long as I
Can forget I've ever known her
Anyplace is alright as long as I
Forget I've ever known her
Cowboys ain't easy to love and they're harder to hold
They'd rather give you a song then diamonds or gold
Lonestar belt buckles and old faded Levi's and each night begins a new day
If you don't understand him and he don't die young
He'll probably just ride away
Mamas' don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys
Don't let 'em pick guitars or drive them old trucks
Let 'em be doctors and lawyers and such
Mamas' don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys
Cause they'll never stay home and they're always alone
Even with someone they love
Cowboys like smokey old pool rooms and clear mountain mornin's
Little warm puppies and children and girls of the night
Them that don't know him won't like him
And them that do sometimes won't know how to take him
He ain't wrong he's just different
But his pride won't let him do things to make you think he's right
Mama don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys
Don't let 'em pick guitars and drive them old trucks
Let 'em be doctors and lawyers and such
Mama don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys
Cause they'll never stay home and they're always alone
Even with someone they love
Mamas' don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys
Don't let 'em pick guitars and drive them old trucks
Let 'em be doctors and lawyers and such
"Honey, I know I've said it too many times before"
I said I'd never say it again
I guess I shouldn't say anything at all since you're supposed to belong to him.
But I just can't let you go without telling you just how much I love you.
So that is why I'm gonna say it one more time
"Honey, come back I just can't stand"
Each lonely day's a little bit longer
Than the last time I held you
Seems like a hundred years ago
Back to his arms and never know
The joy of love that used to taste like
"Honey, come back where you belong to only me."
"Well, I guess that's about all I gotta say."
So I'm just gonna take my bags and I'm gonna walk.
"I know those bright lights are callin' ya, honey."
Big fine cars and fancy clothes.
"But if you ever want somebody to just love ya, and some day you"
"Just may, just give me a call-you know where I am"
And here is what I'll say
"Honey, come back I just can't stand"
Each lonely day's a little bit longer
Than the last time I held you
Seems like a hundred years ago
Back to his arms and never know
The joy of love that used to taste like
"Honey, come back where you belong to only me."
"Honey, come back where you belong to only me."
"Honey, come back"
Where you belong to only me.
"Honey, come back where you belong to only me."
People see us everywhere they all think you really care
But myself I can't deceive I know it's only make believe
My one and only prayer is that some day you'll care
My hopes my dreams come true my one and only you
No one will ever know how much I love you so
My only prayer will be some day you'll care for me but it's only make believe
My hopes my dreams come true my life I give for you
My heart or wedding ring my all my everything
My heart I can't control you lure my very soul
My plans my hopes my schemes you are my every dream but it's only make believe
My one and only prayer is that some day you'll care
My hopes my dreams come true my one and only you
No one will ever know just how much I love you so
My only prayer will be that some day you'll care for me but it's only make believe
"Delta Dawn, what's that flower you have on?"
Could it be a faded rose from days gone by?
And did I hear you say he was a-meeting you here today
To take you to his mansion in the sky?
"She's forty-one and her daddy still calls her ""baby"""
All the folks around Brownsville say she's crazy
Cause she walks dowtown with a suitcase in her hand
Looking for a mysterious dark-haired man
In her younger days they called her Delta Dawn
Prettiest woman you ever laid eyes on
Then a man of low degree stood by her side
And promised her he'd take her for his bride
"Delta Dawn, what's that flower you have on?"
Could it be a faded rose from days gone by?
And did I hear you say he was a-meeting you here today
To take you to his mansion in the sky?
"Delta Dawn, what's that flower you have on?"
Could it be a faded rose from days gone by?
And did I hear you say he was a-meeting you here today
To take you to his mansion in the sky?
"Delta Dawn, what's that flower you have on?"
Could it be a faded rose from days gone by?
And did I hear you say he was a-meeting you here today
To take you to his mansion in the sky?
"Delta Dawn, what's that flower you have on?"
Could it be a faded rose from days gone by?
And did I hear you say he was a-meeting you here today
To take you to his mansion in the sky?
Everyone considered him the coward of the county
He'd never stood one single time to prove the county wrong
"His mama named him Tommy, but folks just called him yellow"
Something always told me they were reading Tommy wrong
He was only ten years old when his daddy died in prison
"I looked after Tommy, 'cause he was my brother's son"
I still recall the final words my brother said to Tommy
"""Son, my life is over, but yours has just begun"""
"""Promise me, son, not to do the things I've done"
Walk away from trouble if you can
It won't mean you're weak if you turn the other cheek
I hope you're old enough to understand
"Son, you don't have to fight to be a man"""
"There's someone for everyone, and Tommy's love was Becky"
"In her arms, he didn't have to prove he was a man"
"One day while he was working, the Gatlin boys came calling"
"They took turns at Becky, n'there was three of them"
"Tommy opened up the door, and saw his Becky crying"
"The torn dress, the shattered look was more than he could stand"
"He reached above the fireplace, and took down his daddy's picture"
"As the tears fell on his daddy's face, he heard these words again"
"""Promise me, son, not to do the things I've done"
Walk away from trouble if you can
"Now, it won't mean you're weak if you turn the other cheek"
I hope you're old enough to understand
"Son, you don't have to fight to be a man"""
The Gatlin boys just laughed at him when he walked into the barroom
One of them got up and met him halfway 'cross the floor
"When Tommy turned around they said, ""hey look, old yeller's leaving"""
But you could've heard a pin drop when Tommy stopped and locked the door
Twenty years of crawling was bottled up inside him
"He wasn't holding nothin' back, he let 'em have it all"
"When Tommy left the barroom, not a Gatlin boy was standing"
"He said, ""this one's for Becky, as he watched the last one fall"
"""I promised you, Dad, not to do the things you've done"
I walk away from trouble when I can
"Now please don't think I'm weak, I didn't turn the other cheek"
"And papa, I sure hope you understand"
"Sometimes you gotta fight when you're a man"""
There goes my only possession
There goes my everything
I hear footsteps slowly walking
As they gently walk across the lonely floor
And a voice is softly saying
Darling this will be goodbye for evermore
There goes my reason for living
There goes the one of my dreams
There goes my only possession
Oh there goes my everything
As my memory turns back the pages
I can see the happy years we've had before
Now the love that kept this old heart beating
Has been shattered by the closing of the door
There goes my reason for living
There goes the one of my dreams
Well there goes my only possession
Oh there goes my everything
There goes my only possession
Oh there goes my everything
A long time forgotten are dreams that just fell by the way
The good life he promised ain't what she's living today
"But she never complains of the bad times or bad things he's done, Lord"
She just talks about the good times they've had and all the good times to come
She's a good-hearted woman in love with a good-timin' man
She loves him in spite of his ways that she don't understand
"Through teardrops and laughter, they'll pass through this world hand-in-hand,"
A good-hearted woman loving her good timing man
"He like the night life, the bright lights and good-timin' friends"
When the party's all over she'll welcome him back home again
"Lord knows she don't understand him, but she does the best that she can"
Cause she's a good-hearted woman; she loves her good timin' man
She's a good-hearted woman in love with a good-timin' man
She loves him in spite of his ways that she don't understand
"Through teardrops and laughter, they'll pass through this world hand-in-hand,"
A good-hearted woman loving her good timing man
"Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene"
I'm begging of you please don't take my man
"Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene"
Please don't take him just because you can
Your beauty is beyond compare
With flaming locks of auburn hair
With ivory skin and eyes of emerald green
Your smile is like a breath of spring
Your voice is soft like summer rain
And I cannot compete with you
Jolene
He talks about you in his sleep
And there's nothing I can do to keep
From crying when he calls your name
Jolene
And I can easily understand
How you could easily take my man
But you don't know what he means to me
Jolene
"Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene"
I'm begging of you please don't take my man
"Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene"
Please don't take him just because you can
You could have your choice of men
But I could never love again
He's the only one for me
Jolene
I had to have this talk with you
My happiness depends on you
And whatever you decide to do
Jolene
"Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene"
I'm begging of you please don't take my man
"Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene"
Please don't take him even though you can
"Jolene, Jolene"
"Well, I was borned a coal miner's daughter"
"In a cabin, on a hill in Butcher Holler"
We were poor but we had love
That's the one thing that daddy made sure of
He shoveled coal to make a poor man's dollar
My daddy worked all night in the Van Lear coal mines
All day long in the field a hoin' corn
Mommy rocked the babies at night
And read the Bible by the coal oil light
And ever' thing would start all over come break of morn
Daddy loved and raised eight kids on a miner's pay
Mommy scrubbed our clothes on a washboard ever' day
Why I've seen her fingers bleed
"To complain, there was no need"
She'd smile in mommy's understanding way
In the summertime we didn't have shoes to wear
But in the wintertime we'd all get a brand new pair
From a mail order catalog
Money made from selling a hog
Daddy always managed to get the money somewhere
"Yeah, I'm proud to be a coal miner's daughter"
"I remember well, the well where I drew water"
The work we done was hard
At night we'd sleep 'cause we were tired
I never thought of ever leaving Butcher Holler
Well a lot of things have changed since a way back then
And it's so good to be back home again
"Not much left but the floor, nothing lives here anymore"
Except the memory of a coal miner's daughter
"I cried a tear, you wiped it dry"
"I was confused, you cleared my mind"
"I sold my soul, you bought it back for me"
And held me up and gave me dignity
Somehow you needed me
You gave me strength to stand alone again
To face the world out on my own again
You put me high upon a pedestal
So high that I could almost see eternity
"You needed me, you needed me"
And I can't believe it's you
I can't believe it's true
I needed you and you were there
"And I'll never leave, why should I leave?"
I'd be a fool 'cause I finally found someone who really cares
You held my hand when it was cold
When I was lost you took me home
You gave me hope when I was at the end
And turned my lies back into truth again
"You even called me ""friend"""
You gave me strength to stand alone again
To face the world out on my own again
You put me high upon a pedestal
So high that I could almost see eternity
"You needed me, you needed me"
"You needed me, you needed me"
Well me and Homer Jones and Big John Talley
Had a big crap game goin' back in the alley
"And I kept rollin' them sevens , winnin' all them pots"
My luck was so good I could do no wrong
I jest kept on rollin' and controllin' them bones
And finally they jest threw up their hands and said
"""When you hot, you hot"""
"I said ""Yeah?"""
"When you're hot, you're hot"
"And when you're not, you're not"
Put all the money in and let's roll 'em again
"When you're hot, you're hot"
(La la la la la la la) (La la la la la)
"(La la la la la la la, when you're hot, you're hot)"
"Well, now every time I rolled them dice I'd win"
And I was just gettin' ready to roll 'em again
When I heard somethin' behind me
I turned around and there was a big old cop
"He said ""Hello, boys"" and then he gave us a grin 'n' said"
"""Look like I'm gonna hafta haul you all in"
"And keep all that money for evidence"""
"I said, ""Well, son when you hot, you hot"""
"He said ""Yeah"""
"When you're hot, you're hot"
"And when you're not, you're not"
You can 'splain it all down at City Hall
"I say, yeah, when you're hot, you're hot"
You're hot
(La la la la la la la) (La la la la la)
"(La la la la la la la, when you're hot, you're hot)"
"Well, when he took us inta court I couldn't believe my eyes"
The judge was a fishin' buddy that I recognized
"I said ""Hey, judge, old buddy, old pal"""
"""I'll pay ya that hundred I owe ya if you'll get me outta this spot"""
So he gave my friends a little fine to pay
He turned around and grinned at me and said
"""Ninety days, Jerry, when you hot, you hot"""
"n' I said ""Thanks a lot"""
"When you're hot, you're hot"
"And when you're not, you're not"
He let my friends go free and throwed the book at me
"He said ""Well, when you're hot, you're hot"""
"I said ""well I'll tell ya one thing judge, old buddy, old pal"""
"""If you wasn't wearin' that black robe I'd take out in back of this courthouse"
"""And I'd try a little bit of your honor on"""
"""You understand that, you hillbilly?"""
"""Who gonna collect my welfare?"""

The only two things in life that make it worth livin'
Is guitars that tune good and firm feelin' women
I don't need my name in the marquee lights
I got my song and I got you with me tonight
Maybe it's time we got back to the basics of love
"Let's go to Luckenbach, Texas"
With Waylon and Willie and the boys
This successful life we're livin'
Got us feuding like the Hatfields and McCoys
Between Hank Williams' pain songs and
Newberry's train songs and Blue Eyes Cryin' in the Rain
"Out in Luckenbach, Texas ain't nobody feelin' no pain"
"So baby, let's sell your diamond ring"
Buy some boots and faded jeans and go away
This coat and tie is choking me
In your high society you cry all day
We've been so busy keepin' up with the Jones
Four car garage and we're still building on
Maybe it's time we got back to the basics of love
"Let's go to Luckenbach, Texas"
With Waylon and Willie and the boys
This successful life we're livin' got us feudin'
Like the Hatfield and McCoys
Between Hank Williams' pain songs and
Newberry's train songs and Blue Eyes Cryin' in the Rain
"Out in Luckenbach, Texas ain't nobody feelin' no pain"
"Let's go to Luckenbach, Texas"
Willie and Waylon and the boys
This successful life we're livin's got us feudin'
Like the Hatfield and McCoys
Between Hank Williams' pain songs
And Jerry Jeff's train songs and Blue Eyes Cryin' in the Rain
"Out in Luckenbach, Texas there ain't nobody feelin' no pain"
Here you come again
Just when I've begun to get myself together
You waltz right in the door
Just like you've done before
And wrap my heart 'round your little finger
Here you come again
Just when I'm about to make it work without you
You look into my eyes and lie those pretty lies
And pretty soon I'm wond'rin how I came to doubt you.
All you gotta do is smile that smile
And there go all my defenses
Just leave it up to you and in a little while
You're messin' up my mind and fillin' up my senses
Here you come again lookin' better than a body has a right to
And shakin' me up so that all I really know
Is here you come again and here I go
All you gotta do is smile that smile
And there got all my defenses
Just leave it up to you and in a little while
You're messin' up my mind and fillin' up my senses
Here you come again lookin' better than a body has a right to
And shakin' me up so that all I really know
"Is here you come again, and here I go, here I go"
And here I go
And here I go
Here you come again and here I go
Here I go
Shine on me sunshine
Walk with me world
It's a skippidity do da day
"I'm the happiest girl, in the whole U.S.A."
Good morning morning
Hello sunshine
Wake up sleepy head
Why'd we move that bojangle clock so far away from the bed
Just one more minute
That's why we moved it
One more hug would do
Do you love waking up next to me
As much as I love waking up next to you
You make the coffee
I'll make the bed
I'll fix your lunch
And you fix mine
Now tell me the truth
Do these old shoes look funny
Honey it's almost nine
Now you be careful
"Gotta go, I love you"
"Have a beautiful day,"
"And kiss the happiest girl, in the whole U.S.A."
Skippidity do da
Thank you oh Lord for making him for me
And thank you for letting life turn out the way
That I always thought it could be
There once was a time when I could not imagine
How it would feel to say
"I'm happiest girl, in the whole U.S.A"
Now shine on me sunshine
Walk with me world
It's a skippidity do da day
"I'm the happiest girl, in the whole U.S.A."
Shine on me sunshine
Walk with me world
It's a skippidity do da day
"I'm the happiest girl, in the whole U.S.A."
Shine on me sunshine
Walk with me world
It's a skippidity do da day
"I'm the happiest girl, in the whole U.S.A."
If I were a carpenter
And you were a lady
Would you marry me anyway
Would you have my baby?
If you were a carpenter
And I were a lady
I'd marry you anyway
I'd have your baby
If a tinker was my trade
Would I still find you
I'd be carrying the pots you made
Following behind you
Save your love through loneliness
Save your love through sorrow
I gave you my onlyness
Give me your tomorrow
If I were a miller
And a mill wheel grinding
Would you miss your colored blouse
And your soft shoes shining?
If you were a miller
And a mill wheel grinding
I'd not miss my colored blouse
And my soft shoes shining
Save your love through loneliness
Save your love through sorrow
I gave you my onlyness
Give me your tomorrow
If I worked my hands on wood
Would you still love me?
I'd answer you yes I would
And would you not be above me?
If I were a carpenter
And you were a lady
I'd marry you anyway
I'd have your baby
Save your love through loneliness
Save your love through sorrow
I gave you my onlyness
Give me your tomorrow
Hello darlin'
Nice to see you
It's been a long time
You're just as lovely
As you used to be
How's your new love
Are you happy?
Hope you're doin' fine
Just to know means so much to me
What's that darlin'
How am I doin'?
I'm doin' alright
Except I can't sleep
And I cry all night 'til dawn
What I'm tryin' to say is that
I love you and I miss you
And I'm so sorry
That I did you wrong
Look up darlin'
Let me kiss you
Just for old time's sake
Let me hold you in my arms
One more time
Thank you darlin'
May God bless you
And each step brings you closer
To the things you seek to find
Goodbye darlin'
I got to go now
I got to try to find a way
To lose these memories
Of a love so warm and true
And if you should ever
Find it in your heart
To forgive me
Comeback darlin'
I'll be waiting for you
"I'm not Lisa, my name is Julie"
Lisa left you years ago
My eyes are not blue
But mine won't leave you
Til the sunlight has touched your face
She was your morning light
Her smile told of no night
Your love for her grew
With each rising sun
And then one winter day
His hand led hers away
"She left you here drowning in your tears, here"
Where you've stayed for years
"Crying Lisa, Lisa"
"I'm not Lisa, my name is Julie"
Lisa left you years ago
My eyes are not blue
But mine won't leave you
Til the sunlight shines through your face
Take the ribbon from my hair
Shake it loose and let it fall
Lay it soft upon my skin
Like the shadows on the wall
Come and lay down by my side
Til the early mornin' light
All I'm takin' is your time
Help me make it through the night
I don't care what's right or wrong
I won't try to understand
Let the devil take tomorrow
But tonight I need a friend
Yesterday is dead and gone
And tomorrow's out of sight
And it's sad to be alone
Help me make it through the night
And it's sad to be alone
Help me make it through the night
I don't want to be alone
Help me make it through the night
Sometimes when he comes home I'm cookin' breakfast
I haven't slept a wink all night long
I've been layin' in bed thinkin' like a woman
Wonderin' if my man's been doin' me wrong
To think he might be out with another woman
Makes my temper rise with jealousy
But all these years I've never caught him cheatin'
I guess he needs some time away from me
"But when he lo-oves me, he really lo-oves me"
There's nothin' left for me to say-ay
"Oh when he lo-oves me, he really lo-oves me"
He loved me all the way-ay
I'm not ever gonna worry about tomorrow
As long as he makes everything alright today-ay
I'd rather wonder a little and have his lovin'
Cause when he loves me he loves me a-all the way
"When he lo-oves me, he really lo-oves me"
There's nothin' left for me to say-ay
"Oh when he lo-oves me, he really lo-oves me"
He loved me all the way-ay
I'm not ever gonna worry about tomorrow
As long as he makes everything alright today-ay
I'd rather wonder a little and have his lovin'
Cause when he loves me he loves me a-all the way
Cause when he loves me he loves me a-all the way
I realise the way your eyes deceive me
With tender looks that I mistook for love
So take away the flowers that you gave me
And send the kind that you remind me of
"Paper roses, paper roses,"
Oh how real those roses seem to me
But they're only imitation
Like your imitation love for me
I thought that you would be a perfect lover
You seemed so full of sweetness at the start
But like a big red rose that's made of paper
There isn't any sweetness in your heart
"Paper roses, paper roses,"
Oh how real those roses seem to me
But they're only imitation
Like your imitation love for me
If I said you had a beautiful body
Would you hold it against me
"If I swore you were an angel,"
Would you treat me like the devil tonight
If I were dying of thirst
Would your flowing love come quench me
If I said you had a beautiful body
Would you hold it against me
Now we can talk all night about the weather
Tell you 'bout my friends out on the coast
I could ask a lot of crazy questions
Or I could ask what I really want to know
If I said you had a beautiful body
Would you hold it against me
"If I swore you were an angel,"
Would you treat me like the devil tonight
If I were dying of thirst
Would your flowing love come quench me
If I said you had a beautiful body
Would you hold it against me
The rain can fall so soft against the window
The sun can shine so bright up in the sky
"But daddy always told me, ""Don't make small talk"""
"He said, ""Come on out and say what's on your mind"""
So if I said you had a beautiful body
Would you hold it against me
"If I swore you were an angel,"
Would you treat me like the devil tonight
If I were dying of thirst
Would your flowing love come quench me
If I said you had a beautiful body
Would you hold it against me
If I said you had a beautiful body
Would you hold it against me
"If I swore you were an angel,"
Would you treat me like the devil tonight
Sleeping single in a double bed
Thinking over things I wish I'd said
I should have held you but I let you go
Now I'm the one sleeping all alo-oh-one
Sleeping single in a double bed (ooh-oo-ooh)
"Tossing, turning, trying to forget (ahh-ah)"
I could be lying with you instead
I'm sleeping single in a double bed
"I'd pour me a drink, but I'd only be sorry"
"Cause drinking doubles alone, don't make it a par-arty"
Another sleepless night and it's the same old stor-ory
When you're the only one at two in the morning
I-I'm sleeping single in a double bed (ooh-oo-ooh)
Thinking over things I wish I'd said (ahh-ah)
I should have held you but I let you go
Now I'm the one sleeping all alo-oh-one
Sleeping single in a double bed
"Tossing, turning, trying to forget (you-ou)"
I could by lying with you instead
I'm sleeping single in a double bed
I'm sleeping single in a double bed (ah-hah-ah)
Thinking over things I wish I'd said (ooh-ooh)
I should have held you but I let you go
Now I'm the one sleeping all alo-oh-one
Sleeping single in a double bed (ah-hah-ah)
"Tossing, turning, trying to forget (you-ou)"
I could be lying with you instead
I'm sleeping single in a double bed
I-Im sleeping single in a double bed
Thinking over things I wish I'd said (fade)
"While she lays sleeping, I stay out late at night and play my songs"
And sometimes all the nights can be so long
"And it's good when I finally make it home, all alone"
"While she lays dreaming, I try to get undressed without the light"
"And quietly she says ""how was your night?"""
"And I come to her and say, ""it was all right, "" and I hold her tight"
"And she believes in me, I'll never know just what she sees in me"
"I told her someday, if she was my girl, I could change the world"
"With my little songs, I was wrong"
"But she has faith in me, and so I go on trying faithfully"
"And who knows, maybe, on some special night, if my song is right"
"I will find a way, find a way"
"While she lays waiting, I stumble to the kitchen for a bite"
Then I see my old guitar in the night
"Just waiting for me like a secret friend, and there's no end"
"While she lays crying, I fumble with a melody or two"
And I'm torn between the things that I should do
And she says to wake her up when I am through
"God, her love is true"
"And she believes in me, I'll never know just what she sees in me"
"I told her someday if she was my girl, I could change the world"
"With my little songs, I was wrong"
"But she has faith in me, and so I go on trying faithfully"
"And who knows maybe on some special night, if my song is right"
I will find a way
"While she lays, while she waits for me"
Flying cross the desert in a TWA
Saw a women walking
Cross the sand
They been walking thirty miles
In route to L.A. to get
A brown eyed handsome man
The destination was
A brown eyed handsome man
Milo Venus was a beautiful lass
She had the world
In the palm of her hand
But she lost both her arms
In a wrestling match to get
A brown eyed handsome man
She fought and won herself
A brown eyed handsome man
Way back in history
Three thousand years
Back ever since the world began
Been a whole lot a good women
Shedding tears for
A brown eyede handsome man
That's what the trouble was
A brown eyed handsome man
Beautiful daughter couldn't
Make up her mind between
A doctor and a lawyer man
Mamma told her daughter
Go out and find herself
A brown eyed handsome man
Just like your daddy is
A brown eyed handsome man
Arrested on charges
Of unemployment
He was sitting in the witness stand
The judges wife called up
The district attorney said you better
Free that brown eyed man
If you want your job you'd better
Free that brown eyed man
Way back in history
Three thousand years
Back when ever since the world began
Got a whole lot a good woman
Shedding tears for
A brown eyed handsome man
That's what the trouble was
A brown eyed handsome man
Once in every life
Someone comes along
And you came to me
It was almost like a song
You were in my arms
Right where you belong
And we were so in love
It was almost like a song
January through December
We had such a perfect year
Then the flame became a dying ember
All at once you weren't here
Now my broken heart
Cries for you each night
And It's almost like a song
But it's much too sad to write
Now my broken heart
Cries for you each night
And It's almost like a song
But it's much too sad to write
It's too sad to write
