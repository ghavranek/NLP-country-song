I beg your pardon
Jolene, Jolene
There'll be a load of compromisin'
And my soft shoes shining
And shakin' me up so that all I really know
And I wonder just how long
Somehow you needed me
Money made from selling a hog
Come along and share the good times while we can
When ever I chance to meet, some old friends on the street
On the sunday morning sidewalk
I pull out my fiddle and I rosin up the bow
"He said ""Hello, boys"" and then he gave us a grin 'n' said"
But myself I can't deceive I know it's only make believe
My luck was so good I could do no wrong
And papa, I sure hope you understand
(La la la la la la la, when you're hot, you're hot)
I'll just cry all night long
But his pride won't let him do things to make you think he's right
And it's so good to be back home again
With flaming locks of auburn hair
My only prayer will be some day you'll care for me but it's only make believe
Well a lot of things have changed since a way back then
Newberry's train songs and Blue Eyes Cryin' in the Rain
Well there goes my only possession
If I worked my hands on wood
Them that don't know him won't like him
Bitter-sweet memories
That I should have been home yesterday, yesterday
One day while he was working, the Gatlin boys came calling
There's someone for everyone, and Tommy's love was Becky
Daddy always managed to get the money somewhere
As my memory turns back the pages
And there's nothing I can do to keep
Now you be careful
I could sing you a tune and promise you the moon
"""Ninety days, Jerry, when you hot, you hot"""
And every time they ask me why I just smile & say
But I'd rather fight the wind and rain
Just like you've done before
So I'm just gonna take my bags and I'm gonna walk.
Wishing lord that I was stoned
So smile for a while and let's be jolly
Let's go to Luckenbach, Texas
Do these old shoes look funny
Save your love through sorrow
Would you still love me?
When you're runnin' down our country, man
I still recall the final words my brother said to Tommy
Now, it won't mean you're weak if you turn the other cheek
You're walkin' on the fightin' side of me
And ever' thing would start all over come break of morn
And I don't mind 'em switchin' sides
Honey, I know I've said it too many times before
You put me high upon a pedestal
I'd be a fool 'cause I finally found someone who really cares
Forget I've ever known her
Had a big crap game goin' back in the alley
Where you belong to only me.
"I said ""Hey, judge, old buddy, old pal"""
I'm happiest girl, in the whole U.S.A
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Yeah, I'm proud to be a coal miner's daughter
She loves him in spite of his ways that she don't understand
And stumbled down the stairs
But the Lord and my wife wouldn't take it very good
Each lonely day's a little bit longer
If I were a miller
And I kept rollin' them sevens , winnin' all them pots
Here you come again
My hopes my dreams come true my one and only you
I'd have your baby
This successful life we're livin' got us feudin'
I remember well, the well where I drew water
I'd marry you anyway
But you're down when you're ridin' the train that's takin' the long way
He reached above the fireplace, and took down his daddy's picture
Well I got me a fine wife I got me an ole fiddle
If you were a miller
Willie and Waylon and the boys
But I lit my first and watched a small kid
Wind whipping down the neck of my shirt
Walk away from trouble if you can
To meet the day
Hello sunshine
All the folks around Brownsville say she's crazy
If you don't understand him and he don't die young
Sleepin' in our king size bed
With a laughing little girl
Through teardrops and laughter, they'll pass through this world hand-in-hand,
Well I wouldn't trade my life for diamonds and jewels
"""Who gonna collect my welfare?"""
A raisin' me a family and workin' on a farm
And I wish you happiness
Here I go
Big fine cars and fancy clothes.
This successful life we're livin'
I'll be fine when you're gone
He'd never stood one single time to prove the county wrong
Mommy scrubbed our clothes on a washboard ever' day
Seems like a hundred years ago
(La la la la la la la) (La la la la la)
He wasn't holding nothin' back, he let 'em have it all
Honey it's almost nine
And thank you for letting life turn out the way
I hope you're old enough to understand
Rain dripping off the brim of my hat
Darling this will be goodbye for evermore
And found my cleanest dirty shirt
There once was a time when I could not imagine
When the sun's comin' up I got cakes on the griddle
And let her know you think about her when you're gone
I wish you joy
Say it isn't true and
"She's forty-one and her daddy still calls her ""baby"""
Ain't much an old country boy like me can't hack
I'd rather have my fiddle and my farmin' tools
I never promised you a rose garden
Oh there goes my everything
I'd just as soon let you go
One more hug would do
And promised her he'd take her for his bride
When the party's all over she'll welcome him back home again
And kiss the happiest girl, in the whole U.S.A.
And held me up and gave me dignity
I'd be carrying the pots you made
You held my hand when it was cold
When I heard somethin' behind me
Almost heaven, West Virginia
If a tinker was my trade
He was only ten years old when his daddy died in prison
That's why we moved it
I jest kept on rollin' and controllin' them bones
My daddy taught me young how to hunt and how to whittle
Something always told me they were reading Tommy wrong
Cussin' at a can that he was kickin
And so I'll go, but I know
Just when I've begun to get myself together
Out in Luckenbach, Texas ain't nobody feelin' no pain
Why I've seen her fingers bleed
Honey, come back
But if that's what it takes to hold you
You needed me, you needed me
But above all this
I say, yeah, when you're hot, you're hot
Miner's lady, stranger to blue water
Your beauty is beyond compare
And it echoed thru the canyon like
I needed you and you were there
I'm begging of you please don't take my man
As much as I love waking up next to you
The radio reminds me of my home far away
Your voice is soft like summer rain
This successful life we're livin's got us feudin'
All my memories gather round her
I'd answer you yes I would
Well people may try to guess, the secret of my happiness
From a mail order catalog
Jolene
Your smile is like a breath of spring
No one will ever know just how much I love you so
The kids are asleep so I keep it kinda low
Between Hank Williams' pain songs
You've got to kiss an angel good morning
Cause there's something in a sunday
Like the Hatfield and McCoys
"He said, ""this one's for Becky, as he watched the last one fall"
I would give you the world right now on a silver platter
Give me no reasons, give me alibies
That they were singing
Love shouldn't be so melancholy
Please don't take him even though you can
In her arms, he didn't have to prove he was a man
Except the memory of a coal miner's daughter
I turned around and there was a big old cop
"""When you hot, you hot"""
Let 'em be doctors and lawyers and such
Would I still find you
But I'm gonna be where the lights are shinin' on me
Skippidity do da
To complain, there was no need
Here you come again and here I go
But she never complains of the bad times or bad things he's done, Lord
He let my friends go free and throwed the book at me
"""You understand that, you hillbilly?"""
Then I crossed the empty street and
Tomorrow she'll probably want me back
Where hustle's the name of the game
And a voice is softly saying
On the sleeping city sidewalk
If you were a carpenter
Would you have my baby?
That I'd lost somehow
And driving down the road I get a feeling
And here I am'a walking down sixty-six
How it would feel to say
I'll make the bed
As the tears fell on his daddy's face, he heard these words again
Mommy rocked the babies at night
Cause they'll never stay home and they're always alone
Cause she walks dowtown with a suitcase in her hand
Runnin' down the way of life
That didn't hurt
And gripin' 'bout the way things oughta be
Then I headed back for home
When you're runnin' down our country, hoss
They wonder how does a man get to be this way
They'd rather give you a song then diamonds or gold
Can forget I've ever known her
My heart or wedding ring my all my everything
He turned around and grinned at me and said
And I dream of the things I'll do
Well a simple kinda life never did me no harm
Harpin' on the wars we fight
Maybe it's time we got back to the basics of love
I can see the happy years we've had before
Just leave it up to you and in a little while
Getting cards and letters from people I don't even know
Tell me you love me and don't let me cry
So you better think it over
I will always love you
For my clothes
From crying when he calls your name
You make the coffee
Walk with me world
And I stopped beside the Sunday school
And I cannot compete with you
You look into my eyes and lie those pretty lies
Thank God I'm a country boy
And there's nothing short of dying
And your soft shoes shining?
When the work's all done and the sun's settlin' low
I'll think of you each step of the way
You're hot
I read about some squirrelly guy
And somewhere far away
I could promise you things like big diamond rings
But in the wintertime we'd all get a brand new pair
But it sure seems warmer than it did
Daddy loved and raised eight kids on a miner's pay
I've always got a smiling face, anytime & any place
West Virginia, mountain mama
And would you not be above me?
I gave you my onlyness
And pretty soon I'm wond'rin how I came to doubt you.
Honey, come back I just can't stand
I had to have this talk with you
I walk away from trouble when I can
And I were a lady
But you don't know what he means to me
So baby, let's sell your diamond ring
I got my song and I got you with me tonight
Give me your tomorrow
Just one more minute
Or Phoenix Arizona
There goes the one of my dreams
"""Pay for my Cadillac?"""
Even with someone they love
Out in Luckenbach, Texas there ain't nobody feelin' no pain
Cause therels something in a sunday
So high that I could almost see eternity
I guess I shouldn't say anything at all since you're supposed to belong to him.
Is here you come again and here I go
Four car garage and we're still building on
I'd not miss my colored blouse
"I said, ""Well, son when you hot, you hot"""
As they gently walk across the lonely floor
Like I aint got nothing on
And Jerry Jeff's train songs and Blue Eyes Cryin' in the Rain
Or let go oh-whoa-whoa-whoa
A lonely bell was ringing
Now shine on me sunshine
Then a man of low degree stood by her side
Please don't take him just because you can
Save your love through loneliness
That I always thought it could be
Is anybody goin' to San Antone
He talks about you in his sleep
"""If you wasn't wearin' that black robe I'd take out in back of this courthouse"
The work we done was hard
Cause we both know that I'm not
My days are all filled with an easy country charm
Now please don't think I'm weak, I didn't turn the other cheek
And don't it make my brown eyes
I hope life, treats you kind
Along with the sunshine
You're messin' up my mind and fillin' up my senses
Lonestar belt buckles and old faded Levi's and each night begins a new day
And did I hear you say he was a-meeting you here today
"Whadda you mean 'contempt of court'?"""
It's a skippidity do da day
I've been walkin' these streets so long
And wrap my heart 'round your little finger
Following behind you
Bad so I had one more for dessert
Kiss an angel good morning
Shine on me sunshine
The good life he promised ain't what she's living today
Misty taste of moonshine, teardrop in my eye
His mama named him Tommy, but folks just called him yellow
But some of them never learn it's a simple thing
Not much left but the floor, nothing lives here anymore
You gave me strength to stand alone again
And the answer is in this song that I always sing
Lord knows she don't understand him, but she does the best that she can
And here is what I'll say
"I said ""Yeah?"""
But I just can't let you go without telling you just how much I love you.
At night we'd sleep 'cause we were tired
Now tell me the truth
A good-hearted woman loving her good timing man
I, I will always, always love you
It's early to rise, early in the sack
Is here you come again, and here I go, here I go
Good-bye, please don't cry
"When Tommy turned around they said, ""hey look, old yeller's leaving"""
The joy of love that used to taste like
And finally they jest threw up their hands and said
So I fiddle when I can, work when I should
Cowboys ain't easy to love and they're harder to hold
Somewhere along the way
And you know what I'm talkin' about
I'll fix your lunch
Riding out on a horse in a star-spangled rodeo
Cowboys like smokey old pool rooms and clear mountain mornin's
Well, I really don't mind the rain
Would you miss your colored blouse
Runnin' down a way of life
Life ain't nothin' but a funny funny riddle
"""Son, my life is over, but yours has just begun"""
Caught the sunday smell
But I could never love again
And a smile can hide all the pain
I would only be in your way
To face the world out on my own again
I can't believe it's true
Don't it make my brown eyes blue
That makes a body feel alone
Here you come again lookin' better than a body has a right to
And I shaved my face
And here I go
Half as lonesome as the sound
Singin' the same old song
And them that do sometimes won't know how to take him
Delta Dawn, what's that flower you have on?
And there go all my defenses
Say anything but don't say goodbye
And I will always love you
I hear her voice, in the morning hour she calls me
But you don't find roses growin' on stalks of clover
You better look before you leap, still waters run deep
Take me home, down country roads
He was swingin
Looking for a mysterious dark-haired man
The torn dress, the shattered look was more than he could stand
Buy some boots and faded jeans and go away
Tell me no secrets, tell me some lies
Taught me how to love and how to give just a little
I know every crack in these dirty sidewalks of Broadway
They love our milk and honey
"""Promise me, son, not to do the things I've done"
And when you're not, you're not
I sold my soul, you bought it back for me
I don't need my name in the marquee lights
My hopes my dreams come true my life I give for you
Gotta go, I love you
Sunday morning coming down
Well if sweet-talkin' you could make it come true
Would you marry me anyway
My one and only prayer is that some day you'll care
The only two things in life that make it worth livin'
Well, now every time I rolled them dice I'd win
And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't
The secret I'm speaking of, is a woman & a man in love
And offers comin' over the phone
But when they're runnin' down our country, man
Well life on the farm is kinda laid back
I cried a tear, you wiped it dry
Prettiest woman you ever laid eyes on
In the park I saw a daddy
And you were a lady
There's gotta be a little rain some time
And I can't believe it's you
Cause she's a good-hearted woman; she loves her good timin' man
"You even called me ""friend"""
Got us feuding like the Hatfields and McCoys
My heart I can't control you lure my very soul
I never was one of them money hungry fools
Life is old there, older than the trees
Don't know what's come over you
On the road to my horizon
This coat and tie is choking me
Now the love that kept this old heart beating
Of someone fryin chicken
To take you to his mansion in the sky?
"Sometimes you gotta fight when you're a man"""
With no way to hold my head
"""Judge"""
Little warm puppies and children and girls of the night
I said I'd never say it again
No one will ever know how much I love you so
Well, I was borned a coal miner's daughter
Has been shattered by the closing of the door
Don't let 'em pick guitars or drive them old trucks
He'll probably just ride away
Gettin' card and letters from people I don't even know
Who claims that he just don't believe in fightin'
Rhinestone cowboy
There goes my only possession
But what would it matter
"""And I'd try a little bit of your honor on"""
People writing letters back home
Good morning morning
My daddy worked all night in the Van Lear coal mines
And read the Bible by the coal oil light
There goes my everything
Well, when he took us inta court I couldn't believe my eyes
Mamas' don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys
Well, my fiddle was my daddy's till the day he died
Take me home, country roads
There's been a load of compromisin'
If I were a carpenter
A man could wake up dead
My plans my hopes my schemes you are my every dream but it's only make believe
"""Look like I'm gonna hafta haul you all in"
I didn't mean to treat you bad
Let this song that I'm singin' be a warnin'
But I'll still be just as gone
In your high society you cry all day
She just talks about the good times they've had and all the good times to come
I was confused, you cleared my mind
Between Hank Williams' pain songs and
I hear people talkin' bad,
Son, let me tell ya now exactly what I mean
I'd play Sally Goodin all day if I could
Honey, come back where you belong to only me.
I wish you love
One of them got up and met him halfway 'cross the floor
Just may, just give me a call-you know where I am
If you don't love it, leave it
Sleeping under a table at a road side park
That I've been pickin'
And combed my hair
"(When you're hot, you're hot"")"
You've found someone new and
And I love you will always love you
She's a good-hearted woman in love with a good-timin' man
Didn't know just what I had
All day long in the field a hoin' corn
And it took me back to something
Could it be a faded rose from days gone by?
The Gatlin boys just laughed at him when he walked into the barroom
You gave me hope when I was at the end
So that is why I'm gonna say it one more time
"I said ""well I'll tell ya one thing judge, old buddy, old pal"""
Well, I guess that's about all I gotta say.
The disappearing dreams of yesterday
"Son, you don't have to fight to be a man"""
That's all I'm taking with me
Just when I'm about to make it work without you
Yonder comes a truck with the US mail
When you take you gotta give so live and let live
And nice guys get washed away like the snow and the rain
"And keep all that money for evidence"""
My happiness depends on you
We were poor but we had love
And whatever you decide to do
Wake up sleepy head
What you need
He's the only one for me
Mama don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys
Then I fumbled through my closet
And standin' up for things they believe in
And I hope that you have all
"n' I said ""Thanks a lot"""
Taught me how to work and play a tune on the fiddle
Country roads, take me home
Don't it make my brown eyes
Everyone considered him the coward of the county
And I'll never leave, why should I leave?
I know those bright lights are callin' ya, honey.
They're walkin' on the fightin' side of me
Thank you oh Lord for making him for me
Younger than the mountains, blowing like a breeze
Tommy opened up the door, and saw his Becky crying
Wish she hadn't done me that way
I hear footsteps slowly walking
And turned my lies back into truth again
Don't let 'em pick guitars and drive them old trucks
Have a beautiful day,
But they preach about some other way of livin'
"He said ""Well, when you're hot, you're hot"""
My only prayer will be that some day you'll care for me but it's only make believe
Our fightin' men have fought and died to keep
And thank God you're a country boy
People see us everywhere they all think you really care
Don't know when I've been so blue
Yeah, city folk drivin' in a black limousine
You could have your choice of men
I beg your pardon
And I was just gettin' ready to roll 'em again
Dark and dusty, painted on the sky
When I was lost you took me home
Twenty years of crawling was bottled up inside him
Like a rhinestone cowboy
And love her like the devil when you get back home
And a mill wheel grinding
"""I'll pay ya that hundred I owe ya if you'll get me outta this spot"""
Well I woke up Sunday morning
Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River
In a cabin, on a hill in Butcher Holler
He like the night life, the bright lights and good-timin' friends
How you could easily take my man
And there won't always be someone there to pull you out
I never thought of ever leaving Butcher Holler
The judge was a fishin' buddy that I recognized
But honey now I do
That's the one thing that daddy made sure of
A lotta sad people thinkin' that's mighty keen
In the summertime we didn't have shoes to wear
I'm the happiest girl, in the whole U.S.A.
It won't mean you're weak if you turn the other cheek
Back to his arms and never know
All you gotta do is smile that smile
When Tommy left the barroom, not a Gatlin boy was standing
"Said, ""Live a good life and play the fiddle with pride"
It sure is cold today
And there got all my defenses
Than what I've been fighting at home
She'd smile in mommy's understanding way
To the place I belong
And I can easily understand
We've been so busy keepin' up with the Jones
In her younger days they called her Delta Dawn
That you ever dreamed of
Why'd we move that bojangle clock so far away from the bed
But if you ever want somebody to just love ya, and some day you
He shoveled coal to make a poor man's dollar
But there's one thing I want you to know
With cigarettes and songs
When you're hot, you're hot
But you could've heard a pin drop when Tommy stopped and locked the door
With ivory skin and eyes of emerald green
If I should stay
Anyplace is alright as long as I
You waltz right in the door
You can 'splain it all down at City Hall
Is guitars that tune good and firm feelin' women
And he took me by the hand and held me close to his side
"""I promised you, Dad, not to do the things you've done"
So he gave my friends a little fine to pay
With Waylon and Willie and the boys
I looked after Tommy, 'cause he was my brother's son
Than the last time I held you
About the way they have to live here in this country
With a subway token and a dollar tucked inside my shoe
Gettin' cards and letters from people I don't even know
Do you love waking up next to me
A long time forgotten are dreams that just fell by the way
There goes my reason for living
The rest of us can count on bein' free
Put all the money in and let's roll 'em again
He ain't wrong he's just different
"He said ""Yeah"""
I'd smoked my brain the night before
And you fix mine
They took turns at Becky, n'there was three of them
And listened to the song
Well me and Homer Jones and Big John Talley
